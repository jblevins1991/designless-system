# Styless

Styless is a component library developed without styles. This decision was made to make development faster within organizations 
that want to have a design system, but don't find the development of the components to be an appealing option. Just use one of 
our handy [style boilerplates](https://jblevins1991.github.io/styless-react/?path=/story/getting-started-styling-components--page) and style the components the way you would like!

## Benefits

The benfits to adding styles to a component library are as follows.

- reduces learning curve with natural JSX props
- results in a more maintainable design system
- uses typescript to enforce ada compliance in component props
- requires less style overrides or css specificity
- no styling library opinionation

## Getting Started

To start using Styless, you need to install it into your React application.

```shell
// install with npm
npm install @nightowl-developers/styless-react

// install with yarn
yarn add @nightowl-developers/styless-react
```

## Our Dependencies

We disclose all of the depenencies we use in our open source projects. We don't like to re-invent the wheel when something 
can be used to solve a very difficult or expensive problem. But we don't want to introduce too many dependencies into your 
appication. So we will only allow modules that are absolutely necessary.

**Peer Dependencies**

| Module Name                  | Module Version        |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| react                        | ^v18.2.1              |
| react-dom                    | ^v18.2.1              |

**Dependencies**

| Module Name                  | Module Version        |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| classnames                   | ^2.3.1                |

`React` and `React-DOM` are both peer dependencies. We use the new `useTransition`, `useId`, and `useDeferred` hooks that were 
released in React 18. This means that Styless will not work with React versions below 18.

## Our Versioning Strategy

Styless is semantically versioned. This means that the major version number doesn't change unless we make a breaking change to 
the component APIs. The minor version is updated when we add new features and bug fixes bump the patch version.
